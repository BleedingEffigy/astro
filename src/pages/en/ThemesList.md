## Adding a new theme

Since themes are json files, you only have to create a theme json object, save it in a file (the filename will be how to tool refers to it), and then submit a PR request in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/BleedingEffigy/blossom-plus/tree/master/themes)

To create and save daisyui themes you can use [this tool](https://themes.ionevolve.com/) made by [Marshall Thompson](https://twitter.com/marshallswain?s=20)
