Each theme is [hosted on github](https://github.com/BleedingEffigy/blossom-plus/tree/master/themes)

- [Blossom](https://github.com/BleedingEffigy/blossom-plus/blob/master/themes/blossom.json)
- [Mars](https://github.com/BleedingEffigy/blossom-plus/blob/master/themes/mars.json)
- [Xmas](https://github.com/BleedingEffigy/blossom-plus/blob/master/themes/xmas.json)
- [AdventureTime](https://github.com/BleedingEffigy/blossom-plus/blob/master/themes/adventureTime.json)

## Adding a new theme

Since themes are json files, you only have to create a theme json object, save it in a file (the filename will be how to tool refers to it), and then submit a PR request in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/BleedingEffigy/blossom-plus/tree/master/themes)
